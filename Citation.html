However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

                              <br>
                            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

                         <strong>   Verification process </strong>
                      <br>
                            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
                              <br>
                            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
                              <br>
                            Other privacy rights

                            You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.
                            You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
                            You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.

                      <p> When we came up with the idea of Learning Bridge, We thought that  immense pride in the impact our organization has had in South Florida. More than a mere entity, Learning Bridge stands as a beacon of hope for students navigating educational disparities. Motivated by a genuine belief in the potential of every student, we, the founders, established Learning Bridge with a mission to provide rigorous math and English classes throughout the school year.
<br>
                      Having personally witnessed the transformation of students, We can attest to the genuine dedication that drives students around us. It's not just about closing the education gap; it's about empowering local youth with opportunities and skills that will last a lifetime. We thought Learning Bridge as not merely an organization but a powerful catalyst for positive change in the lives of South Florida's students.
<br>
                        What truly sets Learning Bridge apart is our unwavering commitment, extending beyond academic excellence to the creation of a supportive community. We go beyond textbooks, fostering an environment where students not only learn but also develop crucial life skills.

                    Honestly, it's much better than the websites I was designing at your age. Seriously, it's lovely work.
                    And thank you for asking! You're more than welcome to use my name as a guest speaker, as long as the website makes it clear that it's a made-up event.
                    Thank you again for the email, and good luck with the competition! I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for you!
