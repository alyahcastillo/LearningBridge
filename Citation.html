                              <br>
                            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

                         <strong>   Verification process </strong>
                      <br>
                            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
                              <br>
                            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
                              <br>

                            You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.
                            You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
                            You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.

  <strong>14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>
                        <br>
                      Informal Negotiations
                        <br>
                      To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
                        <br>
                      Binding Arbitration
                        <br>
                      If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Miami dade, Florida. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
                        <br>
                      If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Miami Dade, Florida, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
                        <br>
                      If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
                        <br>
                      Restrictions
                        <br>
                      The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
                        <br>
                      Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
                        <br>
                      The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                    <h5> Learning Bridge</h5>
                      <p> When we came up with the idea of Learning Bridge, We thought that  immense pride in the impact our organization has had in South Florida. More than a mere entity, Learning Bridge stands as a beacon of hope for students navigating educational disparities. Motivated by a genuine belief in the potential of every student, we, the founders, established Learning Bridge with a mission to provide rigorous math and English classes throughout the school year.
<br>
                      Having personally witnessed the transformation of students, We can attest to the genuine dedication that drives students around us. It's not just about closing the education gap; it's about empowering local youth with opportunities and skills that will last a lifetime. We thought Learning Bridge as not merely an organization but a powerful catalyst for positive change in the lives of South Florida's students.
<br>
                        What truly sets Learning Bridge apart is our unwavering commitment, extending beyond academic excellence to the creation of a supportive community. We go beyond textbooks, fostering an environment where students not only learn but also develop crucial life skills.

                    <p>We got permission and rights from Ethan Marcotte to use his name for our website. We formally asked him about the permission to use his name for our gala. Here is what he said: 
                   <br>
                      It's so nice to meet you.
                    First, I love the website you've designed. I think you're off to a really strong start - it looks great!
                    Honestly, it's much better than the websites I was designing at your age. Seriously, it's lovely work.

Replit’s total, cumulative liability for any claim, loss or damage arising out of or relating to these terms shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00 USD).

                      NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL LIMIT OR EXCLUDE OUR LIABILITY FOR: (X) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR SUBCONTRACTORS; (Y) FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION; OR (Z) ANY OTHER LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

                      24. Warranty Disclaimer

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance.

                      Replit, Inc. its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, be error-free, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements; or (d) that the Service and/or any content made available through the Service will be accurate or complete.

                      Some jurisdictions do not allow for limited liability or exclusion of implied warranties, so not all of the above limitations and/or warranty disclaimers may apply to you. You acknowledge and understand that the disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis of the agreement between the parties hereto, that the parties have relied upon such disclaimers, exclusions and limitations of liability, and that absent such disclaimers, exclusions and limitation of liability, the terms and conditions of these Terms would be substantially different.

                      25. California Civil Code §1789.3

                      These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

                      Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.

                      27. Assignment
                      These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be freely assigned by Replit without restriction.

                      28. Changes
                      We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time.

                      By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.

                      29. hCaptcha
                      We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter "hCaptcha") on our website. This service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation ("IMI"). hCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the "invisible mode" may take place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a "data processor" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a "service provider" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/ and https://hcaptcha.com/terms.
